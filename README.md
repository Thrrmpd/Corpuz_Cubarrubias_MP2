## Execution Time and Performance Analysis
**1**

**Manual Input Analysis (Correctness Test)**

When we tested the program using manual input, it helped us confirm that the assembly function was actually computing the right acceleration values. By entering our own Vi, Vf, and T values, we could see the results clearly and compare them with what we expected based on the formula. The outputs matched every time, including cases with negative acceleration, which gave us confidence that the logic was correct before moving on to larger tests. Overall, the manual mode showed that the assembly code was accurate and reliable with real user-provided data.

**Benchmarch Input Analysis**

The program was tested using four required input sizes:
- Input Size 10
- Input Size 100
- Input Size 1000
- Input Size 10000

Each dataset was processed 30 times, and the average execution time was recorded.

**Execution Time Results**

| Input Size    | Average Time (Seconds)                                                     | 
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10      | 0.000000                                         | 
| 100   | 0.000000                          | 
| 1000  | 0.000003                                 | 
| 10000          | 0.000032 |
